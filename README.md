## What if US income inequality has not risen? - Financial Times

I found this article quite surprising to read. The idea that income inequality has risen over the past few decades is something that many people, myself included, have taken as a given - something that the article mentions. It dedicates itself to tackling this supposed misconception, addressing individual issues in the studies that establish this idea and proposing that while income inequality did technically rise, progressive taxation mitigated its real effect.

I'm still skeptical of the authors claims that income inequality has not risen since the 80s. While they pointed out errors in their studies, they gave little reasoning as to what their methodology was when they did their study determining how much it has increased. Perhaps I should do more research. However, I do think taxation isn't often talked about in these discussions - although, they vary wildly by state.

## Opinion: Why a new study gives a misleading view of inequality in America - CNN

This article, also dealing with income inequality, argues the opposite of the Financial Times article - that income inequality has indeed increased dramatically since the 1980s. The authors address a lot of erroneous ways to compute income inequality, before settling on the Social Security Administration (SSA) data on annual wage earnings. Through this data, they conclude that income inequality has dramatically increased, and that policy must be implemented to address this issue.

I find the results this article suggests more in line with what I've been seeing, especially with the recent news that Elon Musk's $55 billion paycheck was voided by the courts. However, I don't understand the reasoning behind why annual wage earnings are more important than any other metric. Yes, they are unaltered compared to most other data, but there are a lot of other metrics to take into account when computing income inequality - such as taxation.
